# Details
a linear regression of gene expression with the predictors concentration, cell age, treatment (two levels), cell type (two levels), and media (two levels)

done a previous study and got $R^{2} = 0.1$

want power = 90% and significant level = 5%

# Calculations
```{r}
R2 <- 0.1
result <- pwr.f2.test(u = 5, f2 = R2/(1-R2), sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
sample_size <- round(result$v,0)+6
sample_size
```
